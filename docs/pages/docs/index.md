**React Hardware** is a custom React renderer targeting the Firmata protocol.
Please note that it is one of the first major custom renderers supported outside
of Facebook’s product infrastructure teams. The renderer API is non-public and
as such this project may experience some internal churn as that progresses. It
is our intent that you as the consumer of this should be shielded from this, but
alas Disclaimer Disclaimer.
